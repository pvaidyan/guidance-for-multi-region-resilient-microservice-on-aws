# GitHub Actions Workflow Fixes

This document explains the changes made to fix the failing GitHub Actions workflow for dependency vulnerability scanning.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Python Version**: Updated Python version from 3.12 to 3.11
   - Python 3.12 is very recent and might not be available on all GitHub Actions runners
   - Python 3.11 is more widely available and stable

2. **Action Version Pinning**: Updated action references to use specific versions instead of branch references
   - Changed `dependency-check/Dependency-Check_Action@main` to `dependency-check/Dependency-Check_Action@2.9.0`
   - Changed `aquasecurity/trivy-action@master` to `aquasecurity/trivy-action@0.16.1` for all three instances

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Improved Stability**: Using specific versions of actions instead of branch references ensures that the workflow will continue to work even if the actions are updated.

2. **Better Compatibility**: Using Python 3.11 instead of 3.12 ensures better compatibility with GitHub Actions runners.

3. **Predictable Behavior**: Pinned versions provide predictable behavior and make it easier to debug issues.

## Future Recommendations

1. **Regular Updates**: Periodically check for updates to the actions and Python versions used in the workflow.

2. **Testing**: Test the workflow after making changes to ensure it works as expected.

3. **Documentation**: Keep this documentation updated with any future changes to the workflow.

4. **Monitoring**: Monitor the workflow runs to ensure they continue to work as expected.
